## NixOS: KOSS Teaching Task
Problem statement can be found here: [NixOS-KOSS-selection task](https://github.com/kossiitkgp/KOSS-Selection-Tasks/blob/master/Teaching/Linux/NixOS.md)

This repository contains the presentation and links to various sources I preferred for the teaching task given by KOSS( Kharagpur(IIT-KGP) Open Source Society ) for the team-addition interview in the session 2021-2022.

### Different file formats for the presentation ? - `.pdf` is suggested
The original presentation was created in [keynote](https://www.apple.com/in/keynote/), having an extension of `.key`, which might not be supported by other
presentation softwares, thus for windows(and hence for every other distro belonging to the category of *nix) it has been converted to `.ppt`.

The presentation with `.key` extension was converted by [cloudconvert](https://cloudconvert.com/pages-to-docx). 

There is quite a good possibility that you might not be seeing the original version of the presentation, possible reasons can be:
  * You don't have the fonts used in the presentation installed on your system.
  * The conversion has distorted the alignment of images, fonts or whatever you can think of.

Thus the presentation folder has [presentation.pdf](https://github.com/proffapt/koss-interview-nixos/blob/main/presentation/presentation.pdf), which is a pdf of compiled screenshots of the whole presentation from my system, so that one can get
the idea of how exactly the presentation is looking on my system.
